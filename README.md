# meteorapp
My first introduction with Meteor.js. 
This Meteor app allows storing a database (collection in MongoDB) which can be modified in client-side and displaying/adding filtered data (fetched from collection) in Gmap.
Subscriptions, routing, and some security issues are not set properly (yet!).
